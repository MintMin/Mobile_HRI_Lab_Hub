This week's lab is a continuation of the previous week. We explore the role of both *siting*--the location and activity--in interaction, as well as the *form and appearance* of the robot in the interaction.


## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors/Utility Knifes
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. **Found objects and materials** -- You will have to costume your CloneBot so that it fits in the intended setting. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative! We have fabric, just ask!
   
### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Fill in the questions along the way! 
1. 1 photo of costumed device
2. Reflections on the process
3. Video sketch of 1 prototyped interactions with costumed device
4. Submit the items above in the lab2 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report 
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Provide feedback to your peers](#part-a-provide-feedback)

B) [Site the interaction](#part-b-site-the-interaction)

C) [Costume the robot](#part-c-costume-the-robot)

D) [Wizard the robot](#part-d-wizard-the-robot) 

E) [Video record the interaction](#part-e-record)

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Provide Feedback  
You and your teammates will be assigned lab 1 submissions from one other group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.

**Summarize feedback your feedback here.**  

The scenarios were clearly organized and communicated well. The team got quite creative with the storyboards. I found the bouncerBot and the emergencyBot particularly interesting.   

The lecture from last week on humanoid robots got me thinking about if the bouncerBot would actually be as menacing as a bouncer. All in all, the storyboards are well done and easy to follow. The rest of the lab is also completed and explains what the team did for each step.	

## Part B. Site the interaction

Think about where the interaction you are prototyping is going to occur-- on a desk? on a floor? indoors? outdoors?

What other people and objects are in that space?

What activities are going on in that space? What activity is the robot going to be involved in?

\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*
![sites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32082801/218636148-3e348725-e8a6-4924-9ae6-692cdbbf3730.jpg)

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*  
Following are the activities being considered. These are elaborated in the sketch above.  
1. At an airport. This robot could be an escort with your flight details and could help navigate you to the right terminus/ gate.
2. At a train station - similar to the airport, this will escort the user to their destination.
3. At a zoo - this escort robot will take you around the zoo and make sure you do not miss your favorite animals at the zoo.

\*\***What issues or opportunties arise from the site and activities?**\*\*
- Multiple robots are needed at the same location to provide help to multiple people or groups at the same time
- It may be hard for people to find the robot(especially visitors & travelers in our xxxx)
- People might not be used to it and might not like it
- It is gentle and might get pushed around
- It will be hard to map out the places.
- Site will need permissions to allow a moving robot
- The robot might trip people/ have to program it to identify humans


## Part C. Costume the robot

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop one costume so that CloneBot can fit into it's setting.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? 

Pick one of the custumes and make it with paper or cardboard or any other material!

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Include photos of your custumed robot here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\* 

At this time we have no concerns about the robot’s design other than that the size might be a bit small in this case.


## Part D. Wizard the Robot
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the robot while someone interacts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Record

\*\***Take videos of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*  
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ixpdrakYV4ZX44F6jpm0Pg7YsZDhOWA6/view?usp=sharing

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

Our teamates, TAs (love the cloth brought to class!)

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.
